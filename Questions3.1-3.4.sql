/*
 Question 3.1
Write an SQL script that creates a stored procedure that can be used to
create a new city record when only the required data is provided.

Question 3.2
Write an SQL script that creates a stored procedure that can be used to
update the population of a city when only itâ€™s name and country code is
provided.
(Assume that countries do not have duplicate city names within their
borders.)

Question 3.3
Write an SQL script that creates a stored procedure that can used to find
the name and position (latitude and longitude) of all cities in a country that
have an airport.

Question 3.4
Write an SQL script that creates a stored procedure that can used to
create a new user (when given a username and password). The procedure
must provide the new user with only read access to the city table in the
destinations database.

 city id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY, AUTO INCREMENT & Unique ID
 city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL | City name
 lat DECIMAL(9,6) NOT NULL | Latitude
 lng DECIMAL(9,6) NOT NULL | Longitude
 country VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL | Full country name
 country iso VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL | Country ISO code
 population INT(11) | Estimated population
 has airport TINYINT(1) | 0 for no, and 1 for yes
